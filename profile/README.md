The Singapore Airlines App Challenge is a annual global hackathon hosted by the Singapore Airlines Group to find innovative solutions to real-life industry challeges. This is the project repository for the Winning Submission of the App Challenge 2022.

## Problem Statement
How might we use Artificial Intelligence to recommend destinations and ancillary services to customers during the flight booking process, based on their profiles and preferences?

## Solution
Our project used TensorFlow Recommenders A.I., which considers user profiles and preferences to recommend activities, accommodations and other ancillary services to users post flight booking. We aimed to leverage our A.I. recommendation system to create a stickier ecosystem and ultimately increase the revenue streams to the Singapore Airlines Group. Our solution was served directly to the users with a friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA).
